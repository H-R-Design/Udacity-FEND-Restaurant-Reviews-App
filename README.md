## Overview
Take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the user.

## View Web App Locally

1. Download the files from this GitHub to desktop then open up the terminal. From there `cd Desktop` then `cd Udacity-FEND-Restaurant-Reviews-App` then run Python local server as shown in the next step.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
3. If the site deosnt appear to be working as intended re-fresh the page and clear the stored caches to reset the page. 

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
